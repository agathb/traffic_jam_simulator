# traffic_jam_simulator

This is a simple traffic jam simulator that I made for a school project. It is written in Python and uses the Pygame library for graphics.

Ciao agathe.

Ideas: 
class Car
class Road
class Dots #for visualizing the jam in the terminal
class Dynamics #for the car dynamics
class Response_time #for the driver response time and acceleration parameters
